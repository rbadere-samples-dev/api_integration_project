# api_integration_project

This project aims to integrate Snowflake with the OpenWeatherMap API using AWS API Gateway and Lambda. 

The integration allows Snowflake users to fetch real-time weather data via SQL queries, leveraging an external function that securely calls the OpenWeatherMap API through AWS API Gateway.
